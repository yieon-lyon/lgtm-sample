# [Mimir](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/latest/)

Grafana Mimir has a microservices-based architecture. The system has multiple horizontally scalable microservices that can run separately and in parallel. Grafana Mimir microservices are called components.

Grafana Mimirâ€™s design compiles the code for all components into a single binary. The -target parameter controls which component(s) that single binary will behave as.

## Grafana Mimir components
Most components are stateless and do not require any data persisted between process restarts. Some components are stateful and rely on non-volatile storage to prevent data loss between process restarts. For details about each component, see its page in Components.
